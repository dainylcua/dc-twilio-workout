Dumbbell Bench Press,"Pick up the dumbbells off the floor using a neutral grip (palms facing in). Position the ends of the dumbbells in your hip crease, and sit down on the bench. To get into position, lay back and keep the weights close to your chest. Once you are in position, take a deep breath, and press the dumbbells to lockout at the top. Slowly lower the dumbbells under control as far as comfortably possible (the handles should be about level with your chest). Contract the chest and push the dumbbells back up to the starting position. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGqI0Z5ul4k,https://gfycat.com/AlarmedReasonableAustralianfreshwatercrocodile-max-1mb.gif,"8,10,12,12,10"

Dumbbell Floor Press,"Begin sitting on the floor in an upright position with your legs straight and the dumbbells vertically balanced on the floor. Pick up each dumbbell and set it high in your hip crease while maintaining a tight grip. Slowly lay back while keeping the dumbbells close to your chest and bend your knees to roughly 45 degrees and move your feet up slightly. Press the weights to full extension by contracting your triceps and chest. Slowly lower the weight until both elbows touch the floor then press both dumbbells back to the starting position. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions. To complete the exercise, simply lower the weights to the ground in “controlled drop” fashion. It should be a smooth motion but not one requiring excessive effort or one that puts the shoulder under unnecessary risk.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaBOfLlIXjs,https://gfycat.com/optimisticchiefgazelle,"8,10,12"
Seated Dumbbell Press,"Set up an adjustable angle bench to 90 degrees and select the desired weight from the rack. Pick up the dumbbells from the floor using a neutral grip (palms facing in). Position the end of the dumbbells on your knees and sit down on the bench. Using a safe and controlled motion, kick your knees up one at a time in order to get each dumbbell into place. Once the dumbbells are in place, rotate your palms so they are facing forward. Take a deep breath then press the dumbbells overhead by extending the elbows and contracting the deltoids. Slowly lower the dumbbells back to the starting position (the arms should be roughly 90 degrees or slightly lower depending upon limb lengths). Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRxZ6wr5bpA,https://tenor.com/bkXPI.gif,"8,10,12,10"
Dumbbell Lateral Raise,"The dumbbell lateral raise is a good exercise for building width in your upper body which gives you the ""V"" shape. Grab a set of dumbbells and stand straight up with the dumbbells at your sides. Your palms should be facing your body. You should be holding the dumbbells slightly off your body, as this keeps the tension on the side delts. This is your starting position for the exercise. To execute, slowly raise the dumbbells up to around shoulder height. It's important that you do not let your wrists go above your elbows while raising the weight, as this will take the work off the side delts and put it on the front delts. Pause at the top of the movement, and then slowly lower the weight back to the starting position. Do not let the dumbbells touch your body, and then raise them for the next rep.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4p_m96HXMLk,https://gfycat.com/GreedyUnpleasantBlackfootedferret-size_restricted.gif,"8,10,12"
Dumbbell Tricep Overhead Extension,"Select the desired weight from the rack and stand in an open area. To get into position, lift the dumbbell to the top of your shoulder, take a deep breath, overlap your hands around the dumbbell, then press it into position overhead. Maintain an overlapped grip and slowly lower the dumbbell behind your head by unlocking your elbows. Once your forearms reach parallel or just below, drive the dumbbell back to the starting point by extending the elbows and flexing the triceps. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjmgzEmODnI,https://i0.wp.com/post.healthline.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/HL-01.07c.OverheadTricepsExtensionWithDumbbells.gif?h=840,"8,10,12"
