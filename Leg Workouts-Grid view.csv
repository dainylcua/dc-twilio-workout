Dumbbell Squat,"Set up for the dumbbell squat by choosing a pair of dumbbells and holding them down by your sides. Stand with a slight bend in your knees and your feet around shoulder width apart. Keep your head up and your back straight. This is the starting position. Keeping your eyes facing forward slowly lower your body down. Don't lean forward as you come down. Your buttocks should come out and drop straight down. Squat down as far as possible or at least until your thighs are parallel with the floor, and then slowly raise your body back up by pushing through your heels. Do not lock the knees out when you stand up, and then repeat the movement.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_c67Omje48,https://i.pinimg.com/originals/15/9a/04/159a04a00c7e9007a3bcffeb69f5fb55.gif,8,10,12,10,
Dumbbell Stiff Leg Deadlift,"Set up for the dumbbell stiff leg deadlift by choosing a pair of dumbbells and holding them down at your sides. Stand up straight with a slight bend in your knees and your feet around shoulder width apart. This is your starting position. Keep your back as straight as possible and bend over at the waist lowering the dumbbells over the tops of you feet. Your knees should be kept stationary during the movement. Focus on the stretch in your hamstrings, and continue to lower the dumbbells down as far as your hamstrings will let you comfortably. Now engage the hamstrings and begin to raise the dumbbells straight back up. Your eyes should be facing up and your shoulders back. This will prevent your lower back from rounding. Squeeze up through the glutes and hamstrings until you're standing straight up.
